        <h2>This is where the results of the Pokémon Path Query will show up</h2>

        <p>
            Results will show the number of Pokémon the individual can obtain <em>in game</em> based on the input we received on the previous
            page. There will be an option to see the list of pokemon the player can't obtain natively in their current games, as well
            as which games they should buy to complete their collection based on the highest number of pokemon each game would give them.
