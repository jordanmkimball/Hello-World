        <h1> Problems with Catching Them All</h1>

            <h2> Catching every pokemon is a complicated task</h2>
            <p> 
                    Catching them all. It has been the dream pokemon players since Pokemon Red and Blue first 
                    came out 20 years ago. It was a much simpler goal back when there were only a few games and 151 pokemon.
                    However, with over 806 pokemon to catch spread out across 7 generations, and 25 core games, the journey has
                    become not only harder, but far more complicated. Because each there are so many games, each with its own unique
                    set of pokemon. It can be difficult to tell just what path, and which games you should buy to help complete your
                    ultimate pokemon quest. Do you need to buy all 25, or would just a few of the games be enough to complete your collection?

                <h3>Lets say you have the following games:</h3>
                <!--An ordered list of some of the pokemon games-->
                <ol>
                    <li>Pokemon Ultra Moon</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Alpha Saphire</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Yellow: Special Pickachu edition (3DS)</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Saphire</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Is this enough games to capture all 806 pokemon? What if you had a friend with Pokemon Ultra Sun to trade you all the missing pokemon from
                    Pokemon Ultra Moon? If you can't catch them all in just those games, how many can you catch? What if you received some event pokemon 
                    that filled in some of the <strong>gaps</strong> how many would you need then? The question is difficult to answer.
